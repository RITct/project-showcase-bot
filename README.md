# project-showcase-bot

A discord bot to help showcase your projects


### What does this do?

This bot aids in creating a showcase channel for your discord server.

Server admin could react with a preconfigured emoji to github links to add them to the showcase channel.

For now only the link and the description of the repo(if provided), would be shared in the showcase. 

### Usage

1. Set your environment variables(refer example env file).
2. Configure your `TARGET_EMOJI` in `app/config.py`.
3. Add bot to your server.
4. Ensure bot has write access to your project showcase channel.
